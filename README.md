Math.js is an extensive math library for JavaScript and Node.js. It features a flexible expression parser with support for symbolic computation, comes with a large set of built-in functions and constants, and offers an integrated solution to work with different data types like numbers, big numbers, complex numbers, fractions, units, and matrices. Powerful and easy to use.

- Is compatible with JavaScript's built-in Math library.
- Contains a flexible expression parser.
- Does symbolic computation.
- Comes with a large set of built-in functions and constants.
- Can be used as a command line application as well.
- Runs on any JavaScript engine.
- Is easily extensible.
- Open source.

## Usage

Math.js can be used in both node.js and in the browser.

Install math.js using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mathjs):

    npm install mathjs

Or download mathjs via one of the CDN's listed on the downloads page:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[https://mathjs.org/download.html](https://mathjs.org/download.html#download)

Math.js can be used similar to JavaScript's built-in Math library. Besides that,
math.js can evaluate
[expressions](https://mathjs.org/docs/expressions/index.html)
and supports
[chained operations](https://mathjs.org/docs/core/chaining.html).

```js
import {
  atan2, chain, derivative, e, evaluate, log, pi, pow, round, sqrt
} from 'mathjs'

// functions and constants
round(e, 3)                    // 2.718
atan2(3, -3) / pi              // 0.75
log(10000, 10)                 // 4
sqrt(-4)                       // 2i
pow([[-1, 2], [3, 1]], 2)      // [[7, 0], [0, 7]]
derivative('x^2 + x', 'x')     // 2 * x + 1

// expressions
evaluate('12 / (2.3 + 0.7)')   // 4
evaluate('12.7 cm to inch')    // 5 inch
evaluate('sin(45 deg) ^ 2')    // 0.5
evaluate('9 / 3 + 2i')         // 3 + 2i
evaluate('det([-1, 2; 3, 1])') // -7

// chaining
chain(3)
    .add(4)
    .multiply(2)
    .done()  // 14
```

See the [Getting Started](https://mathjs.org/docs/getting_started.html) for a more detailed tutorial.


## Browser support

Math.js works on any ES6 compatible JavaScript engine, including node.js, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.


## Documentation

## Build

First clone the project from github:

    git clone git@github.com:josdejong/mathjs.git
    cd mathjs

Install the project dependencies:

    npm install

Then, the project can be build by executing the build script via npm:

    npm run build

This will build ESM output, CommonJS output, and the bundle math.js
from the source files and put them in the folder lib.


## Develop

When developing new features for mathjs, it is good to be aware of the following background information.

### Code

The code of `mathjs` is written in ES modules, and requires all files to have a real, relative path, meaning the files must have a `*.js` extension. Please configure adding file extensions on auto import in your IDE.

### Architecture

What mathjs tries to achieve is to offer an environment where you can do calculations with mixed data types,
like multiplying a regular `number` with a `Complex` number or a `BigNumber`, and work with all of those in matrices.
Mathjs also allows to add a new data type, like say `BigInt`, with little effort.

The solution that mathjs uses has two main ingredients:

- **Typed functions**. All functions are created using [`typed-function`](https://github.com/josdejong/typed-function/). This makes it easier to (dynamically) create and extend a single function with new data types, automatically do type conversions on function inputs, etc. So, if you create function multiply for two `number`s, you can extend it with support for multiplying two `BigInts`. If you define a conversion from `BigInt` to `number`, the typed-function will automatically allow you to multiply a `BigInt` with a `number`.

- **Dependency injection**. When we have a function `multiply` with support for `BigInt`, thanks to the dependency injection, other functions using `multiply` under the hood, like `prod`, will automatically support `BigInt` too. This also works the other way around: if you don't need the heavyweight `multiply` (which supports BigNumbers, matrices, etc), and you just need a plain and simple number support, you can use a lightweight implementation of `multiply` just for numbers, and inject that in `prod` and other functions.

At the lowest level, mathjs has immutable factory functions which create immutable functions. The core function `math.create(...)` creates a new instance having functions created from all passed factory functions. A mathjs instance is a collection of created functions. It contains a function like `math.import` to allow extending the instance with new functions, which can then be used in the expression parser.

### Implementing a new function

A common case is to implement a new function. This involves the following steps:

- Implement the function in the right category, for example `./src/function/arithmetic/myNewFunction.js`, where you can replace `arithmetic` with the proper category, and `myNewFunction` with the name of the new function. Add the new function to the index files `./src/factoriesAny.js` and possibly `./src/factoriesNumber.js`.
- Write documentation on the function in the source code comment of `myNewFunction.js`. This documentation is used to auto generate documentation on the website.
- Write embedded documentation for the new function in `./src/expression/embeddedDocs/function/arithmetic/myNewFunction.js`. Add the new documentation to the index file `./src/expression/embeddedDocs/embeddedDocs.js`.
- Write unit tests for the function in `./test/unit-tests/function/arithmetic/myNewFunction.test.js`.
- Write a TypeScript definition for the new function in `./types/index.d.ts`, and write tests for it in `./types/index.ts`. Normally, two definitions need to be added: one for the static function `math.myNewFunction(...)` and one for the chained API `math.chain(...).myNewFunction(...)`.
- Ensure the code style is ok by running `npm run lint` (run `npm run format` to fix the code style automatically).


### Build scripts

The build script currently generates two types of output:

- **any**, generate entry points to create full versions of all functions
- **number**: generating and entry points to create lightweight functions just supporting `number`

For each function, an object is generated containing the factory functions of all dependencies of the function. This allows to just load a specific set of functions, and not load or bundle any other functionality. So for example, to just create function `add` you can do `math.create(addDependencies)`.


## Test

To execute tests for the library, install the project dependencies once:

    npm install

Then, the tests can be executed:

    npm test

Additionally, the tests can be run on FireFox using [headless mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Headless_mode):

    npm run test:browser

To run the tests remotely on BrowserStack, first set the environment variables `BROWSER_STACK_USERNAME` and `BROWSER_STACK_ACCESS_KEY` with your username and access key and then execute:

    npm run test:browserstack

You can separately run the code linter, though it is also executed with `npm test`:

    npm run lint

To automatically fix linting issue, run:

    npm run format

To test code coverage of the tests:

    npm run coverage

To see the coverage results, open the generated report in your browser:

    ./coverage/lcov-report/index.html


### Continuous integration testing

Continuous integration tests are run on [Github Actions](https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/actions) and [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com) every time a commit is pushed to github. Github Actions runs the tests for different versions of node.js, and BrowserStack runs the tests on all major browsers.
