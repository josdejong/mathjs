# How to publish math.js

This document describes the steps required to publish a new version of math.js.


## Test

Test whether the library works correctly by running the tests:

    npm test

Test whether the npm library is ok by installing it locally:

    cd ../tmp-folder
    npm install ../mathjs

Check whether the library works and looks ok.


## Update version number

Update the version number in both package.json and bower.json.


## Update history

Update the date and version number in the file HISTORY.md. Verify whether all
changes in the new version are described.


## Build library

Build the distribution files ./dist/math.js and ./dist/math.min.js by running:

    jake

After the build is complete, verify if the files are created and contain the
correct date and version number in the header.


## Commit

- Commit the final code.
- Merge the develop branch into the master branch.
- Push to github.

Now go to travis-ci and verify if the tests run fine there as well:

  https://travis-ci.org/josdejong/mathjs

If everything is well, create a tag for the new version, like:

    git tag v1.2.4
    git push --tags


## Publish

Publish to npm:

    npm publish

Publish to jam.js:

    jam publish

No need to publish for bower: The library is already published because of the
new version tag.

Publish at http://jspkg.com: go to the website, select the github project,
select the new version and press the button.

Publish at cdnjs:

- clone the cdnjs project
- pull changes: `git pull upstream`
- add the new version of the library under /ajax/libs/mathjs/
  - add new folder /x.y.z/ with the new library
  - update the version number in package.json
- test the library by running `npm test`
- then do a pull request with as title "[author] Update mathjs to x.y.z"
  (with correct version).


## Test published libraries

Install the libraries locally and test whether they work correctly:

    cd tmp-folder
    npm install mathjs
    bower install mathjs


## Update the website

The website is located in the gh-pages branch of the project.

Wait until the new version is available on cdnjs.org.

Copy the files `./dist/math.js` and `./dist/math.min.js` from the master branch
to the folder `js/lib` of the gh-pages branch of the math.js project.
Run the following script in the root of the project:

    node updateversion.js

Commit and push the changes in the gh-pages branch.

Test whether the website shows the updated library (can have a little delay).


## Update version number

Switch to the develop branch, and update the version numbers in package.json and
bower.json to a new snapshot version, like

    1.2.5-SNAPSHOT

commit and push the changes.


## Done

Time to drink a beer.
