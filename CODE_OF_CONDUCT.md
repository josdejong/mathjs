# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We are committed to establishing an environment characterized by respect and tolerance, where each individual feels welcomed and valued. We firmly oppose any form of aggression or mistreatment, regardless of age or gender. To uphold these principles, we define the following standards:

## Unacceptable Behaviors

- Utilizing sexualized language or imagery, or engaging in sexual advances or attention of any kind
- Participating in trolling, making insulting or derogatory comments, or launching personal or political attacks
- Engaging in public or private harassment
- Disclosing others' private information, such as physical or email addresses, without their explicit consent
- Conducting oneself in a manner that could reasonably be deemed inappropriate within a professional context

## Considerations

If you believe you've violated a community standard and received a punishment, and you think it was a misunderstanding, you may submit a request for review to have the case analyzed.

## Review Requests

To request a review, you must send a private message via my personal Gmail or GitHub, detailing the message that led to the ban and explaining why you believe the ban was an error.

### Penalties

### 1. Warning

For minor infractions, you will receive a warning to delete the offending comment, which will be taken into account for future penalties.

### 2. Temporary Ban

For serious offenses or if you have previously received a warning, a temporary ban will be imposed, depending on the severity of the infraction.

### 3. Permanent Ban

If you have already been temporarily banned and commit another offense, you will be permanently banned from commenting or creating an issue in the project.
