Background:

Expression trees are commonly parsed as binary trees, and mathjs does this too.
That means that a mathjs expression tree likely looks like:
http://collegelabs.co/clabs/nld/images/524px-Expression_Tree.svg.png

e.g. 2+2+2 is parsed by mathjs as 2 + 2+2 (a plus node with children 2 and 2+2)
However...
1. This is more complicated than needed. 2+2+2 is the same as 2+(2+2)
2. To collect like terms, we actually *need* it to be flat. e.g. with 2x+(2+2x),
   there's no easy way to know that there are two 2x's to collect without
   running up and down the tree. If we flatten to 2x+2+2x, it becomes a lot
   easier to collect like terms to (2x+2x) + 2, which would then be combined to
   4x + 2
The purpose of flatteOperands is to flatten the tree in this way.

e.g. an expression that is grouped in the tree like
(2 + ((4 * ((1 + 2) + (3 + 4))) * 8))
should be flattened to look like:
(2 + (4 * (1 + 2 + 3 + 4) * 8))

Subtraction and division are also flattened, though that gets a bit more
complicated and you may as well start reading through the code if you're
interested in how that works

// e.g. 2+2+2 is parsed by mathjs as 2+(2+2), but this would change that to
// 2+2+2, ie one + node that has three children.
