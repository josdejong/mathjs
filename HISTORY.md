# History


## not yet released, version 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT

- String input is now converted to numbers by default for all functions. 
- Adding two strings will no longer concatenate them, but will convert the 
  strings to numbers and add them.
- Implemented support for fractions, powered by the library `fraction.js`.
- Implemented matrix LU decomposition with partial pivoting and a LU based 
  linear equations solver (functions `lup` and `lusolve`). Thanks @rjbaucells.
- Implemented a new configuration option `predictable`, which can be set to
  true in order to ensure predictable function output types.
- Implemented function `intersect`. Thanks @kv-kunalvyas.
- Implemented support for adding `toTex` properties to custom functions.
  Thanks @FSMaxB.
- Implemented util functions `isInteger`, `isNegative`, `isNumeric`, 
  `isPositive`, and `isZero`.
- Large internal refactoring, allowing to create custom bundles of math.js.
- Function `typeof` no longer returns lower case names, but now returns lower
  case names for primitives (like `number`, `boolean`, `string`), and 
  upper-camel-case for non-primitives (like `Array`, `Complex`, `Function`).
- Function `import` now returns the imported objects.
- Function `import` no longer supports a module name as argument. Instead,
  modules can be loaded using require: `math.import(require('module-name'))`.

  errors on duplicates by default.
- Method `Node.compile()` no longer needs `math` to be passed as argument.
- Function `sum` now returns zero when input is an empty array. Thanks @FSMAxB.
- The size of Arrays is no longer validated. Matrices will validate this on
  creation.

    - Renamed `params` to `args` and vice versa to make things consistent.
    - Renamed `Block.nodes` to `Block.blocks`.
    - `FunctionNode` now has a `name: string` instead of a `symbol: SymbolNode`.
    - Changed constructor of `RangeNode` to
      `new RangeNode(start: Node, end: Node [, step: Node])`.
    - Nodes for a `BlockNode` must now be passed via the constructor instead

- Fixed `2e` giving a syntax error instead of being parsed as `2 * e`.


## 2014-09-12, version 1.0.1

  a scalar.
- Fixed some missing docs and broken links in the docs.


## 2014-09-04, version 1.0.0

- `math.number` can convert units to numbers (requires a second argument)
- Fixed some precedence issues with the range and conversion operators.

- Implemented support for `null` in all functions.
- Implemented support for "rawArgs" functions in the expression parser. Raw 
  functions are invoked with unevaluated parameters (nodes).
- Expressions in the expression parser can now be spread over multiple lines,
  like '2 +\n3'.
- Changed default value of the option `wrap` of function `math.import` to false.
- Changed the default value for new entries in a resized matrix when to zero. 
  To leave new entries uninitialized, use the new constant `math.uninitialized` 
  as default value.
- Renamed transform property from `__transform__` to `transform`, and documented
  the transform feature.
- Fixed a bug in `math.import` not applying options when passing a module name.
- A returned matrix subset is now only squeezed when the `index` consists of
  scalar values, and no longer for ranges resolving into a single value. 


## 2014-08-03, version 0.26.0

- A new instance of math.js can no longer be created like `math([options])`,
  to prevent side effects from math being a function instead of an object.
  Instead, use the function `math.create([options])` to create a new instance.
- Implemented `BigNumber` support for all constants: `pi`, `tau`, `e`, `phi`,
  `E`, `LN2`, `LN10`, `LOG2E`, `LOG10E`, `PI`, `SQRT1_2`, and `SQRT2`.
- Implemented `BigNumber` support for functions `gcd`, `xgcd`, and `lcm`.
- Fixed function `gxcd` returning an Array when math.js was configured 
  as `{matrix: 'matrix'}`.
- Multi-line expressions now return a `ResultSet` instead of an `Array`.
- Implemented transforms (used right now to transform one-based indices to 
  zero-based for expressions).
- When used inside the expression parser, functions `concat`, `min`, `max`,
  and `mean` expect an one-based dimension number.
- Functions `map` and `forEach` invoke the callback with one-based indices
  when used from within the expression parser.
- When adding or removing dimensions when resizing a matrix, the dimensions
  are added/removed from the inner side (right) instead of outer side (left).
- Improved index out of range errors.
- Fixed function `concat` not accepting a `BigNumber` for parameter `dim`.
- Function `squeeze` now squeezes both inner and outer singleton dimensions.
- Output of getting a matrix subset is not automatically squeezed anymore
  except for scalar output.
- Renamed `FunctionNode` to `FunctionAssignmentNode`, and renamed `ParamsNode`
  to `FunctionNode` for more clarity.
- Fixed broken auto completion in CLI.
- Some minor fixes.


## 2014-07-01, version 0.25.0

- The library now immediately returns a default instance of mathjs, there is
  no need to instantiate math.js in a separate step unless one ones to set 
  configuration options: 
  
        // instead of:
        var mathjs = require('mathjs'),  // load math.js
            math = mathjs();             // create an instance
      
        // just do:
        var math = require('mathjs');
- Implemented support for implicit multiplication, like `math.eval('2a', {a:3})`
  and `math.eval('(2+3)(1-3)')`. This changes behavior of matrix indexes as 
  well: an expression like `[...][...]` is not evaluated as taking a subset of 
  the first matrix, but as an implicit multiplication of two matrices.
- Removed utility function `ifElse`. This function is redundant now the 
  expression parser has a conditional operator `a ? b : c`.
- Fixed a bug with multiplying a number with a temperature,  
  like `math.eval('10 * celsius')`.
- Fixed a bug with symbols having value `undefined` not being evaluated.


## 2014-06-20, version 0.24.1

- Something went wrong with publishing on npm.


## 2014-06-20, version 0.24.0

- Objects `Complex`, `Unit`, and `Help` now return their string representation
  when calling `.valueOf()`.
- Changed the default number of significant digits for BigNumbers from 20 to 64.
- Changed the behavior of the conditional operator (a ? b : c) to lazy 
  evaluating.
- Fixed imported, wrapped functions not accepting `null` and `undefined` as
  function arguments.


## 2014-06-10, version 0.23.0

- Renamed some functions (everything now has a logical, camel case name):
  - Renamed functions `edivide`, `emultiply`, and `epow` to `dotDivide`, 
    `dotMultiply`, and `dotPow` respectively. 
  - Renamed functions `smallereq` and `largereq` to `smallerEq` and `largerEq`.
  - Renamed function `unary` to `unaryMinus` and added support for strings.
- `end` is now a reserved keyword which cannot be used as function or symbol
  name in the expression parser, and is not allowed in the scope against which
  an expression is evaluated.
- Implemented function `unaryPlus` and unary plus operator.
- Implemented function `deepEqual` for matrix comparisons. 
- Added constant `phi`, the golden ratio (`phi = 1.618...`).
- Added constant `version`, returning the version number of math.js as string.
- Added unit `drop` (`gtt`).
- Fixed not being able to load math.js using AMD/require.js.
- Changed signature of `math.parse(expr, nodes)` to `math.parse(expr, options)`
  where `options: {nodes: Object.<String, Node>}`
- Removed matrix support from conditional function `ifElse`.
- Removed automatic assignment of expression results to variable `ans`. 
  This functionality can be restored by pre- or postprocessing every evaluation, 
  something like:
  
        function evalWithAns (expr, scope) {
          var ans = math.eval(expr, scope);
          if (scope) {
            scope.ans = ans;
          }
          return ans;

  square brackets, for example `A[1, 1:3]` instead of `A(1, 1:3)`.
- Removed need to use the `function` keyword for function assignments in the
  expression parser, you can define a function now like `f(x) = x^2`.
- Implemented a compilation step in the expression parser: expressions are
  compiled into JavaScript, giving much better performance (easily 10x as fast).

- Resizing matrices now leaves new elements undefined by default instead of
  filling them with zeros. Function `resize` now has an extra optional
  parameter `defaultValue`.
- Range operator `:` in expression parser has been given a higher precedence.
- Functions don't allow arguments of unknown type anymore.
- Options be set when constructing a math.js instance or using the new function
  `config(options`. Options are no longer accessible via `math.options`.
- Renamed `scientific` notation to `exponential` in function `format`.
- Function `format` outputs exponential notation with positive exponents now
  always with `+` sign, so outputs `2.1e+3` instead of `2.1e3`.
- Fixed function `squeeze` not being able squeeze into a scalar.
- Some fixes and performance improvements in the `resize` and `subset`
  functions.

  - node.js: `var math = require('mathjs')();`
  - browser: `var math = mathjs();`
- Implemented support for multiplying vectors with matrices.
- Improved number formatting:
  - Function `format` now support various options: precision, different
    notations (`fixed`, `scientific`, `auto`), and more.
  - Numbers are no longer rounded to 5 digits by default when formatted.
  - Implemented a function `format` for `Matrix`, `Complex`, `Unit`, `Range`,
    and `Selector` to format using options.
  - Function `format` does only stringify values now, and has a new parameter
    `precision` to round to a specific number of digits.
  - Removed option `math.options.precision`,
    use `math.format(value [, precision])` instead.
  - Fixed formatting numbers as scientific notation in some cases returning
    a zero digit left from the decimal point. (like "0.33333e8" rather than
    "3.3333e7"). Thanks @husayt.
- Implemented a function `print` to interpolate values in a template string,
  this functionality was moved from the function `format`.
- Implemented statistics function `mean`. Thanks Guillermo Indalecio Fernandez
  (@guillermobox).
- Extended and changed `max` and `min` for multi dimensional matrices: they now
  return the maximum and minimum of the flattened array. An optional second

- Renamed option `math.options.matrix.default` to
  `math.options.matrix.defaultType`.
- Removed support for comparing complex numbers in functions `smaller`,
  `smallereq`, `larger`, `largereq`. Complex numbers cannot be ordered.


## 2013-10-08, version 0.14.0

- Introduced an option `math.options.matrix.default` which can have values
  `matrix` (default) or `array`. This option is used by the functions `eye`,
  `ones`, `range`, and `zeros`, to determine the type of matrix output.
- Getting a subset of a matrix will automatically squeeze the resulting subset,
  setting a subset of a matrix will automatically unsqueeze the given subset.
- Removed concatenation of nested arrays in the expression parser.
  You can now input nested arrays like in JavaScript. Matrices can be
  concatenated using the function `concat`.
- The matrix syntax `[...]` in the expression parser now creates 1 dimensional
  matrices by default. `math.eval('[1,2,3,4]')` returns a matrix with
  size `[4]`, `math.eval('[1,2;3,4]')` returns a matrix with size `[2,2]`.
- Documentation is restructured and extended.
- Fixed non working operator `mod` (modulus operator).


## 2013-09-03, version 0.13.0

- Implemented support for booleans in all relevant functions.
- Implemented functions `map` and `forEach`. Thanks Sebastien Piquemal (@sebpic).
- All construction functions can be used to convert the type of variables,
  also element-wise for all elements in an Array or Matrix.
- Changed matrix indexes of the expression parser to one-based with the
  upper-bound included, similar to most math applications. Note that on a
  JavaScript level, math.js uses zero-based indexes with excluded upper-bound.
- Removed support for scalars in the function `subset`, it now only supports
  Array, Matrix, and String.
- Removed the functions `get` and `set` from a selector, they are a duplicate
  of the function `subset`.
- Replaced functions `get` and `set` of `Matrix` with a single function
  `subset`.
- Some moving around with code and namespaces:
  - Renamed namespace `math.expr` to `math.expression` (contains Scope, Parser,
    node objects).
  - Renamed namespace `math.docs` to `math.expression.docs`.
  - Moved `math.expr.Selector` to `math.chaining.Selector`.
- Fixed some edge cases in functions `lcm` and `xgcd`.

  `pickRandom(array)`. Thanks Sebastien Piquemal (@sebpic).
- Implemented function `distribution(name)`, generating a distribution object
  with functions `random`, `randomInt`, `pickRandom` for different
  distributions. Currently supporting `uniform` and `normal`.
- Changed the behavior of `range` to exclude the upper bound, so `range(1, 4)`
  now returns `[1, 2, 3]` instead of `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
- Changed the syntax of `range`, which is now `range(start, end [, step])`
  instead of `range(start, [step, ] end)`.
- Changed the behavior of `ones` and `zeros` to geometric dimensions, for
  example `ones(3)` returns a vector with length 3, filled with ones, and
  `ones(3,3)` returns a 2D array with size [3, 3].
- Changed the return type of `ones` and `zeros`: they now return an Array when
  arguments are Numbers or an Array, and returns a Matrix when the argument
  is a Matrix.
- Change matrix index notation in parser from round brackets to square brackets,
  for example `A[0, 0:3]`.
- Removed the feature introduced in v0.10.0 to automatically convert a complex
  value with an imaginary part equal to zero to a number.
- Fixed zeros being formatted as null. Thanks @TimKraft.

- Some fixes in the end user documentation.


## 2013-07-08, version 0.10.0

- For complex calculations, all functions now automatically replace results
  having an imaginary part of zero with a Number. (`2i * 2i` now returns a
  Number `-4` instead of a Complex `-4 + 0i`).
- Implemented support for injecting custom node handlers in the parser. Can be
  used for example to implement a node handler for plotting a graph.
- Implemented end user documentation and a new `help` function.
- Functions `size` and `squeeze` now return a Matrix instead of an Array as
  output on Matrix input.
- Added a constant tau (2 * pi). Thanks Zak Zibrat (@palimpsests).

- Implemented function `subset`, to get or set a subset from a matrix, string,
  or other data types.
- Implemented construction functions number and string (mainly useful inside
  the parser).
- Improved function `det`. Thanks Bryan Cuccioli (@bcuccioli).
- Moved the parse code from prototype math.expr.Parser to function math.parse,
  simplified Parser a little bit.
- Strongly simplified the code of Scope and Workspace.
- Fixed function mod for negative numerators, and added error messages in case
  of wrong input.


## 2013-05-18, version 0.8.2

- Extended the import function and some other minor improvements.
- Fixed a bug in merging one dimensional vectors into a matrix.
- Fixed a bug in function subtract, when subtracting a complex number from a
  real number.


## 2013-05-10, version 0.8.1

- Fixed an npm warning when installing mathjs globally.


## 2013-05-10, version 0.8.0

- Implemented a command line interface. When math.js is installed globally via
  npm, the application is available on your system as 'mathjs'.
- Implemented `end` keyword for index operator, and added support for implicit
  start and end (expressions like `a(2,:)` and `b(2:end,3:end-1)` are supported
  now).
- Function math.eval is more flexible now: it supports variables and multi-line
  expressions.
- Removed the read-only option from Parser and Scope.
- Fixed non-working unequal operator != in the parser.
- Fixed a bug in resizing matrices when replacing a subset.
- Fixed a bug in updating a subset of a non-existing variable.
- Minor bug fixes.


## 2013-05-04, version 0.7.2

- Fixed method unequal, which was checking for equality instead of inequality.
  Thanks @FJS2.


## 2013-04-27, version 0.7.1

- Improvements in the parser:
  - Added support for chained arguments.
  - Added support for chained variable assignments.
  - Added a function remove(name) to remove a variable from the parsers scope.
  - Renamed nodes for more consistency and to resolve naming conflicts.
  - Improved stringification of an expression tree.
  - Some simplifications in the code.
  - Minor bug fixes.
- Fixed a bug in the parser, returning NaN instead of throwing an error for a
  number with multiple decimal separators like `2.3.4`.
- Fixed a bug in Workspace.insertAfter.
- Fixed: math.js now works on IE 6-8 too.


## 2013-04-20, version 0.7.0

- Implemented method `math.eval`, which uses a readonly parser to evaluate
  expressions.
- Implemented method `xgcd` (extended eucledian algorithm). Thanks Bart Kiers
  (@bkiers).
- Improved math.format, which now rounds values to a maximum number of digits
  instead of decimals (default is 5 digits, for example `math.format(math.pi)`
  returns `3.1416`).
- Added examples.
- Changed methods square and cube to evaluate matrices element wise (consistent
  with all other methods).
- Changed second parameter of method import to an object with options.
- Fixed method math.typeof on IE.
- Minor bug fixes and improvements.


## 2013-04-13, version 0.6.0

- Implemented chained operations via method math.select(). For example
  `math.select(3).add(4).subtract(2).done()` will return `5`.
- Implemented methods gcd and lcm.
- Implemented method `Unit.in(unit)`, which creates a clone of the unit with a
  fixed representation. For example `math.unit('5.08 cm').in('inch')` will
  return a unit which string representation always is in inch, thus `2 inch`.
  `Unit.in(unit)` is the same as method `math.in(x, unit)`.
- Implemented `Unit.toNumber(unit)`, which returns the value of the unit when
  represented with given unit. For example
  `math.unit('5.08 cm').toNumber('inch')` returns the number `2`, as the
  representation of the unit in inches has 2 as value.
- Improved: method `math.in(x, unit)` now supports a string as second parameter,
  for example `math.in(math.unit('5.08 cm'), 'inch')`.
- Split the end user documentation of the parser functions from the source
  files.
- Removed function help and the built-in documentation from the core library.
- Fixed constant i being defined as -1i instead of 1i.
- Minor bug fixes.


## 2013-04-06, version 0.5.0

- Implemented data types Matrix and Range.
- Implemented matrix methods clone, concat, det, diag, eye, inv, ones, size,
  squeeze, transpose, zeros.
- Implemented range operator `:`, and transpose operator `'` in parser.
- Changed: created construction methods for easy object creation for all data
  types and for the parser. For example, a complex value is now created
  with `math.complex(2, 3)` instead of `new math.Complex(2, 3)`, and a parser
  is now created with `math.parser()` instead of `new math.parser.Parser()`.
- Changed: moved all data types under the namespace math.type, and moved the
  Parser, Workspace, etc. under the namespace math.expr.
- Changed: changed operator precedence of the power operator:
  - it is now right associative instead of left associative like most scripting
    languages. So `2^3^4` is now calculated as `2^(3^4)`.
  - it has now higher precedence than unary minus most languages, thus `-3^2` is
    now calculated as `-(3^2)`.
- Changed: renamed the parsers method 'put' into 'set'.
- Fixed: method 'in' did not check for units to have the same base.


## 2013-03-16, version 0.4.0

- Implemented Array support for all methods.
- Implemented Array support in the Parser.
- Implemented method format.
- Implemented parser for units, math.Unit.parse(str).
- Improved parser for complex values math.Complex.parse(str);
- Improved method help: it now evaluates the examples.
- Fixed: a scoping issue with the Parser when defining functions.
- Fixed: method 'typeof' was not working well with minified and mangled code.
- Fixed: errors in determining the best prefix for a unit.


## 2013-03-09, version 0.3.0

- Implemented Workspace
- Implemented methods cot, csc, sec.
