# 2022-07-23, version 11.0.0

!!! BE CAREFUL: BREAKING CHANGES !!!

Breaking changes:

- Dropped official support for IE11. 
- Upgraded to `typed-function@3`, see [josdejong/typed-function/HISTORY.md](https://github.com/josdejong/typed-function/blob/develop/HISTORY.md#2022-05-12-version-300). Thanks @gwhitney. Most importantly: 
    - Conversions now have preference over `any`.
    - The `this` variable is no longer bound to the typed function itself.
    - The properties `typed.types`, `typed.conversions`, and `typed.ignore` 
      have been removed.
    - There are new static functions available like `typed.referTo`, 
      `typed.referToSelf`, `typed.addTypes`, `typed.addConversions`.
- Implement amended "Rule 2" for implicit multiplication (#2370, #2460):
  when having a division followed by an implicit multiplication, the division 
  gets higher precedence over the implicit multiplication when (a) the 
  numerator is a constant with optionally a prefix operator (`-`, `+`, `~`), 
  and (b) the denominator is a constant. For example: formerly `-1 / 2 x` was 
  interpreted as `-1 / (2 * x)` and now it is interpreted as `(-1 / 2) * x`.
  Thanks @gwhitney.
- Drop elementwise matrix support for trigonometric functions, exp, log, gamma,
  square, sqrt, cube, and cbrt to prevent confusion with standard matrix 
  functions (#2440, #2465). Instead, use `math.map(matrix, fn)`. 
  Thanks @gwhitney.
- Simplify: convert equivalent function calls into operators, for example, 
  `add(2, x)` will now be simplified into `2 + x` (#2415, #2466).
  Thanks @gwhitney.
- Removed the automatic conversion from `number` to `string` (#2482).
  Thanks @gwhitney.
- Fix #2412: let function `diff` return an empty matrix when the input contains
  only one element (#2422).
- Internal refactoring in the `simplifyCore` logic (#2490, #2484, #2459).
  The function `simplifyCore` will no longer (partially) merge constants, that 
  behavior has been moved to `simplifyConstant`. The combination of 
  `simplifyConstant` and `simplifyCore` is still close to the old behavior 
  of `simplifyCore`, but there are some differences. To reproduce the same 
  behavior as the old `simplifyCore`, you can use 
  `math.simplify(expr, [math.simplifyCore, math.simplifyConstant])`. 
  Thanks to the refactoring, `simplify` is more thorough in reducing constants. 
  Thanks @gwhitney.
- Disable support for splitting rest parameters in chained calculations 
  (#2485, #2474). For example: `math.chain(3).max(4, 2).done()` will now throw
  an error rather than return `4`, because the rest parameter of 
  `math.max(...number)` has been split between the contents of the chain and 
  the arguments to the max call. Thanks @gwhitney.
- Function `typeOf` now returns `function` (lowercase) for a function instead 
  of `Function` (#2560). Thanks @gwhitney.

  Thanks @laureen-m and @mattvague.

- Extend `eigs` to support general complex matrices, see #1741. Thanks @m93a.
- DenseMatrix and SparseMatrix are now iterable, see #1184. Thanks @m93a.
- Implemented utility functions `matrixFromRows`, `matrixFromColumns`, and 
  `matrixFromFunction`, see #2155, #2153. Thanks @m93a.
- Added TypeScript definitions to the project, making it redundant to install
  `@types/mathjs`, and making it easier to improve the definitions. See #2187, 
  #2192. Thanks @CatsMiaow.
- Upgraded dependencies
  - `complex.js@2.0.13` (fixing #2211). Thanks @infusion

    suffix specifying the word size such as `i16` or `i32`.
  - Function `format` now supports more notations: `bin`, 'hex', and `oct`,
    for example `format(255, {notation: "hex"})`.
  - The functions `format`, `bin`, `hex`, `oct` now allow specifying a wordSize, 
    like `bin(10, 32)` and `format(10, {notation: "bin", wordSize: 32})`.

# 2020-11-06, version 8.0.0

!!! BE CAREFUL: BREAKING CHANGES !!!

- You can now use mathjs directly in node.js using ES modules without need for 
  a transpiler (see #1928, #1941, #1962). 
  Automatically loading either commonjs code or ES modules code is improved.
  All generated code is moved under `/lib`: the browser bundle is moved from 
  `/dist` to `/lib/browser`, ES module files are moved to `/lib/esm`, 
  and commonjs files are moved to `/lib/cjs`. Thanks @GreenImp.
- Non-minified bundle `dist/math.js` is no longer provided. Either use the
  minified bundle, or create a bundle yourself.
- Replaced random library `seed-random` with `seedrandom`, see #1955. 
  Thanks @poppinlp.
- Breaking changes in `pickRandom`, see #1990, #1976.
  - Will no longer return the input matrix when the given number is greater 
    than the length of the provided possibles. Instead, the function always
    returns results with the requested number of picks.
  - Will now return a `Matrix` as output when input was a `Matrix`.
  - Introduced a new syntax:
    
    ```
    math.pickRandom(array, { weights, number, elementWise })
    ```
  - Introduced a new option `elementWise`, which is `true` by default. 
    When setting `elementWise` to false, an array containing arrays will return
    random pick of arrays instead of the elements inside of the nested arrays.


# 2020-11-02, version 7.6.0

- Implemented function `rotate(w, theta)`. See #1992, #1160. Thanks @rnd-debug.

  with 2 or more dimensions instead of only from a vector, see #1974.
  Thanks @KonradLinkowski.


# 2020-10-07, version 7.4.0

- Implemented support for passing a precision in functions `ceil`, `floor`, 
  and `fix`, similar to `round`, see #1967, #1901. Thanks @rnd-debug.
- Implemented function `rotationMatrix`, see #1160, #1984. Thanks @rnd-debug.
- Implement a clear error message when using `sqrtm` with a matrix having 
  more than two dimensions. Thanks @KonradLinkowski.
- Update dependency `decimal.js` to `10.2.1`.

  expression parser, and implemented functions `bin`, `oct`, and `hex` for 
  formatting. Thanks @clnhlzmn.
- Fix #1964: inconsistent calculation of negative dividend modulo for 
  `BigNumber` and `Fraction`. Thanks @ovk.


# 2020-08-24, version 7.2.0

- Implemented new function `diff`, see #1634, #1920. Thanks @Veeloxfire.

  Thanks @rnd-debug. 


# 2020-07-13, version 7.1.0

- Implement support for recursion (self-referencing) of typed-functions, 
  new in `typed-function@2.0.0`. This fixes #1885: functions which where 
  extended with a new data type did not always work. Thanks @nickewing.
- Fix #1899: documentation on expression trees still using old namespace 
  `math.expression.node.*` instead of `math.*`.


# 2020-06-24, version 7.0.2

- Fix #1882: have `DenseMatrix.resize` and `SparseMatrix.resize` accept 
  `DenseMatrix` and `SparseMatrix` as inputs too, not only `Array`.
- Fix functions `sum`, `prod`, `min`, and `max` not throwing a conversion error
  when passing a single string, like `sum("abc")`.


# 2020-05-30, version 7.0.1

- Fix #1844: clarify the documentation of function `eigs`. Thanks @Lazersmoke.
- Fix #1855: Fix error in the documentation for `math.nthRoots(x)`.  
- Fix #1856: make the library robust against Object prototype pollution.


# 2020-05-07, version 7.0.0

Breaking changes:

- Improvements in calculation of the `dot` product of complex values. 
  The first argument is now conjugated. See #1761. Thanks @m93a.

- Removed all deprecation warnings introduced in v6. 
  To upgrade smoothly from v5 to v7 or higher, upgrade to v6 first
  and resolve all deprecation warnings.


# 2020-05-04, version 6.6.5

- Fix #1834: value `Infinity` cannot be serialized and deserialized. 
  This is solved now with a new `math.replacer` function used as 
  `JSON.stringify(value, math.replacer)`.
- Fix #1842: value `Infinity` not turned into the latex symbol `\\infty`.

- Fix `eigs` not using `config.epsilon`.


# 2020-03-29, version 6.6.2

- Fix #1789: Function `eigs` not calculating with BigNumber precision

  matrix instead of checking the returned dimensions and type of the callback.
- Add a caret to dependencies (like) `^1.2.3`) to allow downstream updates
  without having to await a new release of mathjs.


# 2020-01-08, version 6.5.0

  making it impossible to instantiate a zero-based version of the expression
  parser. See #782.


# 2019-11-20, version 6.2.4

- Fixed #1669: function 'qr' threw an error if the pivot was zero,
  thanks @kevinkelleher12 and @harrysarson.
- Resolves #942: remove misleading assert in 'qr'. Thanks @harrysarson.

# 2019-06-08, version 6.0.0

!!! BE CAREFUL: BREAKING CHANGES !!!

### Most notable changes

1.  Full support for **ES modules**. Support for tree-shaking out of the box.

    Load all functions:

    ```js
    import * as math from 'mathjs'
    ```

    Use a few functions:

    ```js
    import { add, multiply } from 'mathjs'
    ```

    Load all functions with custom configuration:

    ```js
    import { create, all } from 'mathjs'
    const config = { number: 'BigNumber' }
    const math = create(all, config)
    ```

    Load a few functions with custom configuration:

    ```js
    import { create, addDependencies, multiplyDependencies } from 'mathjs'
    const config = { number: 'BigNumber' }
    const { add, multiply } = create({
      addDependencies,
      multiplyDependencies
    }, config)
    ```

2.  Support for **lightweight, number-only** implementations of all functions:

    ```
    import { add, multiply } from 'mathjs/number'
    ```

3.  New **dependency injection** solution used under the hood.


### Breaking changes

- Node 6 is no longer supported.

- Functions `config` and `import` are not available anymore in the global
  context:

  ```js
  // v5
  import * as mathjs from 'mathjs'
  mathjs.config(...) // error in v6.0.0
  mathjs.import(...) // error in v6.0.0
  ```

  Instead, create your own mathjs instance and pass config and imports
  there:

  ```js
  // v6
  import { create, all } from 'mathjs'
  const config = { number: 'BigNumber' }
  const mathjs = create(all, config)
  mathjs.import(...)
  ```

- Renamed function `typeof` to `typeOf`, `var` to `variance`,
  and `eval` to `evaluate`. (the old function names are reserved keywords
  which can not be used as a variable name).
- Deprecated the `Matrix.storage` function. Use `math.matrix` instead to create
  a matrix.
- Deprecated function `math.expression.parse`, use `math.parse` instead.
  Was used before for example to customize supported characters by replacing
  `math.parse.isAlpha`.
- Moved all classes like `math.type.Unit` and `math.expression.Parser` to
  `math.Unit` and `math.Parser` respectively.
- Fixed #1428: transform iterating over replaced nodes. New behavior
  is that it stops iterating when a node is replaced.
- Dropped support for renaming factory functions when importing them.
- Dropped fake BigNumber support of function `erf`.
- Removed all index.js files used to load specific functions instead of all, like:

  ```
  // v5
  // ... set up empty instance of mathjs, then load a set of functions:
  math.import(require('mathjs/lib/function/arithmetic'))
  ```

  Individual functions are now loaded simply like:

  ```js
  // v6
  import { add, multiply } from 'mathjs'
  ```

  To set a specific configuration on the functions:

  ```js
  // v6
  import { create, addDependencies, multiplyDependencies } from 'mathjs'
  const config = { number: 'BigNumber' }
  const math = create({ addDependencies, multiplyDependencies }, config)
  ```

  See example `advanced/custom_loading.js`.

- Updated the values of all physical units to their latest official values.
  See #1529. Thanks @ericman314.

### Non breaking changes

- Implemented units `t`, `tonne`, `bel`, `decibel`, `dB`, and prefixes
  for `candela`. Thanks @mcvladthegoat.
- Fixed `epsilon` setting being applied globally to Complex numbers.
- Fix `math.simplify('add(2, 3)')` throwing an error.
- Fix #1530: number formatting first applied `lowerExp` and `upperExp`
  and after that rounded the value instead of the other way around.
- Fix #1473: remove `'use strict'` in every file, not needed anymore.


# 2019-05-18, version 5.10.3

## 2018-02-25, version 4.0.0

!!! BE CAREFUL: BREAKING CHANGES !!!

Breaking changes (see also #682):

- **New expression compiler**

    The compiler of the expression parser is replaced with one that doesn't use
    `eval` internally. See #1019. This means:

    - a slightly improved performance on most browsers.
    - less risk of security exploits.
    - the code of the new compiler is easier to understand, maintain, and debug.

    Breaking change here: When using custom nodes in the expression parser,
    the syntax of `_compile` has changed. This is an undocumented feature though.

- **Parsed expressions**

    - The class `ConstantNode` is changed such that it just holds a value
      instead of holding a stringified value and it's type.
      `ConstantNode(valueStr, valueType`) is now `ConstantNode(value)`
      Stringification uses `math.format`, which may result in differently
      formatted numeric output.

    - The constants `true`, `false`, `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`, `Infinity`,
      and `uninitialized` are now parsed as ConstantNodes instead of
      SymbolNodes in the expression parser. See #833.

- **Implicit multiplication**

    - Changed the behavior of implicit multiplication to have higher
      precedence than explicit multiplication and division, except in
      a number of specific cases. This gives a more natural behavior
      for implicit multiplications. For example `24h / 6h` now returns `4`,
      whilst `1/2 kg` evaluates to `0.5 kg`. Thanks @ericman314. See: #792.
      Detailed documentation: https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/blob/v4/docs/expressions/syntax.md#implicit-multiplication.

    - Immediately invoking a function returned by a function like `partialAdd(2)(3)`
      is no longer supported, instead these expressions are evaluated as
      an implicit multiplication `partialAdd(2) * (3)`. See #1035.

- **String formatting**

    - In function `math.format`, the options `{exponential: {lower: number, upper: number}}`
      (where `lower` and `upper` are values) are replaced with `{lowerExp: number, upperExp: number}`
      (where `lowerExp` and `upperExp` are exponents). See #676. For example:
      ```js
      math.format(2000, {exponential: {lower: 1e-2, upper: 1e2}})
      ```
      is now:
      ```js
      math.format(2000, {lowerExp: -2, upperExp: 2})
      ```

    - In function `math.format`, the option `notation: 'fixed'` no longer rounds to
      zero digits  when no precision is specified: it leaves the digits as is.
      See #676.

- **String comparison**

    Changed the behavior of relational functions (`compare`, `equal`,
    `equalScalar`, `larger`, `largerEq`, `smaller`, `smallerEq`, `unequal`)
    to compare strings by their numeric value they contain instead of
    alphabetically. This also impacts functions `deepEqual`, `sort`, `min`,
    `max`, `median`, and `partitionSelect`. Use `compareNatural` if you
    need to sort an array with text. See #680.

- **Angle units**

    Changed `rad`, `deg`, and `grad` to have short prefixes,
    and introduced `radian`, `degree`, and `gradian` and their plurals
    having long prefixes. See #749.

- **Null**

    - `null` is no longer implicitly casted to a number `0`, so input like
      `math.add(2, null)` is no longer supported. See #830, #353.

    - Dropped constant `uninitialized`, which was used to initialize
      leave new entries undefined when resizing a matrix is removed.
      Use `undefined` instead to indicate entries that are not explicitly
      set. See #833.

- **New typed-function library**

    - The `typed-function` library used to check the input types
      of functions is completely rewritten and doesn't use `eval` under
      the hood anymore. This means a reduced security risk, and easier
      to debug code. The API is the same, but error messages may differ
      a bit. Performance is comparable but may differ in specific
      use cases and browsers.

Non breaking changes:

- Thanks to the new expression compiler and `typed-function` implementation,
  mathjs doesn't use JavaScript's `eval` anymore under the hood.
  This allows using mathjs in environments with security restrictions.
  See #401.
- Implemented additional methods `isUnary()` and `isBinary()` on
  `OperatorNode`. See #1025.
- Improved error messages for statistical functions.
- Upgraded devDependencies.
- Fixed #1014: `derivative` silently dropping additional arguments
  from operator nodes with more than two arguments.


## 2018-02-07, version 3.20.2

- Upgraded to `typed-function@0.10.7` (bug-fix release).

  arguments wrongly: `simplify('f(x, y, z)') evaluated to `f(f(x, y), z)`
  instead of `f(x, y, z)`. Thanks @joelhoover.
- Fixed `simplify` throwing an error in some cases when simplifying unknown
  functions, for example `simplify('f(4)')`. Thanks @joelhoover.

## 2016-03-04, version 3.0.0

### breaking changes

- More restricted support for implicit multiplication in the expression
  parser: `(...)(...)` is now evaluated as a function invocation,
  and `[...][...]` as a matrix subset.
- Matrix multiplication no longer squeezes scalar outputs to a scalar value,
  but leaves them as they are: a vector or matrix containing a single value.
  See #529.
- Assignments in the expression parser now return the assigned value rather
  than the created or updated object (see #533). Example:

  ```
  A = eye(3)
  A[1,1] = 2   # this assignment now returns 2 instead of A
  ```

- Expression parser now supports objects. This involves a refactoring and
  extension in expression nodes:
  - Implemented new node `ObjectNode`.
  - Refactored `AssignmentNode`, `UpdateNode`, and `IndexNode` are refactored
    into `AccessorNode`, `AssignmentNode`, and `IndexNode` having a different API.
- Upgraded the used BigNumber library `decimal.js` to v5. Replaced the
  trigonometric functions of math.js with those provided in decimal.js v5.
  This can give slightly different behavior qua round-off errors.
- Replaced the internal `Complex.js` class with the `complex.js` library
  created by @infusion.
- Entries in a matrix (typically numbers, BigNumbers, Units, etc) are now
  considered immutable, they are no longer copied when performing operations on
  the entries, improving performance.
- Implemented nearly equal comparison for relational functions (`equal`,
  `larger`, `smaller`, etc.) when using BigNumbers.
- Changed the casing of the configuration options `matrix` (`Array` or `Matrix`)
  and `number` (`number`, `BigNumber`, `Fraction`) such that they now match
  the type returned by `math.typeof`. Wrong casing gives a console warning but
  will still work.
- Changed the default config value for `epsilon` from `1e-14` to `1e-12`,
  see #561.

### non-breaking changes

- Extended function `pow` to return the real root for cubic roots of negative
  numbers. See #525, #482, #567.
- Implemented support for JSON objects in the expression parser and the
  function `math.format`.
- Function `math.fraction` now supports `BigNumber`, and function
  `math.bignumber` now supports `Fraction`.
- Expression parser now allows function and/or variable assignments inside
  accessors and conditionals, like `A[x=2]` or `a > 2 ? b="ok" : b="fail"`.
- Command line interface:
  - Outputs the variable name of assignments.
  - Fixed not rounding BigNumbers to 14 digits like numbers.
  - Fixed non-working autocompletion of user defined variables.
- Reorganized and extended docs, added docs on classes and more. Thanks @hgupta9.
- Added new units `acre`, `hectare`, `torr`, `bar`, `mmHg`, `mmH2O`, `cmH2O`,
  and added new aliases `acres`, `hectares`, `sqfeet`, `sqyard`, `sqmile`,
  `sqmiles`, `mmhg`, `mmh2o`, `cmh2o`. Thanks @hgupta9.
- Fixed a bug in the toString method of an IndexNode.
- Fixed angle units `deg`, `rad`, `grad`, `cycle`, `arcsec`, and `arcmin` not
  being defined as BigNumbers when configuring to use BigNumbers.

- Implemented util functions `isInteger`, `isNegative`, `isNumeric`,
  `isPositive`, and `isZero`.

### breaking changes

- String input is now converted to numbers by default for all functions.
- Adding two strings will no longer concatenate them, but will convert the
  strings to numbers and add them.
- Function `index` does no longer accept an array `[start, end, step]`, but
  instead accepts an array with arbitrary index values. It also accepts
  a `Range` object as input.
- Function `typeof` no longer returns lower case names, but now returns lower
  case names for primitives (like `number`, `boolean`, `string`), and
  upper-camel-case for non-primitives (like `Array`, `Complex`, `Function`).

- Implemented functions `sort(x [, compare])` and `flatten(x)`.
- Implemented support for `null` in all functions.
- Implemented support for "rawArgs" functions in the expression parser. Raw
  functions are invoked with unevaluated parameters (nodes).
- Expressions in the expression parser can now be spread over multiple lines,
  like '2 +\n3'.
- Changed default value of the option `wrap` of function `math.import` to false.
- Changed the default value for new entries in a resized matrix when to zero.
  To leave new entries uninitialized, use the new constant `math.uninitialized`

  the transform feature.
- Fixed a bug in `math.import` not applying options when passing a module name.

  scalar values, and no longer for ranges resolving into a single value.


## 2014-08-03, version 0.26.0

- A new instance of math.js can no longer be created like `math([options])`,
  to prevent side effects from math being a function instead of an object.
  Instead, use the function `math.create([options])` to create a new instance.
- Implemented `BigNumber` support for all constants: `pi`, `tau`, `e`, `phi`,
  `E`, `LN2`, `LN10`, `LOG2E`, `LOG10E`, `PI`, `SQRT1_2`, and `SQRT2`.
- Implemented `BigNumber` support for functions `gcd`, `xgcd`, and `lcm`.
- Fixed function `gxcd` returning an Array when math.js was configured
  as `{matrix: 'matrix'}`.
- Multi-line expressions now return a `ResultSet` instead of an `Array`.

  and `mean` expect an one-based dimension number.
- Functions `map` and `forEach` invoke the callback with one-based indices
  when used from within the expression parser.
- When adding or removing dimensions when resizing a matrix, the dimensions
  are added/removed from the inner side (right) instead of outer side (left).
- Improved index out of range errors.

  to `FunctionNode` for more clarity.
- Fixed broken auto completion in CLI.
- Some minor fixes.


## 2014-07-01, version 0.25.0

- The library now immediately returns a default instance of mathjs, there is
  no need to instantiate math.js in a separate step unless one ones to set
  configuration options:

        // instead of:
        var mathjs = require('mathjs'),  // load math.js
            math = mathjs();             // create an instance

        // just do:
        var math = require('mathjs');
- Implemented support for implicit multiplication, like `math.eval('2a', {a:3})`
  and `math.eval('(2+3)(1-3)')`. This changes behavior of matrix indexes as
  well: an expression like `[...][...]` is not evaluated as taking a subset of
  the first matrix, but as an implicit multiplication of two matrices.
- Removed utility function `ifElse`. This function is redundant now the
  expression parser has a conditional operator `a ? b : c`.
- Fixed a bug with multiplying a number with a temperature,
  like `math.eval('10 * celsius')`.
- Fixed a bug with symbols having value `undefined` not being evaluated.


## 2014-06-20, version 0.24.1

  when calling `.valueOf()`.
- Changed the default number of significant digits for BigNumbers from 20 to 64.

  evaluating.
- Fixed imported, wrapped functions not accepting `null` and `undefined` as
  function arguments.


## 2014-06-10, version 0.23.0

- Renamed some functions (everything now has a logical, camel case name):
  - Renamed functions `edivide`, `emultiply`, and `epow` to `dotDivide`,
    `dotMultiply`, and `dotPow` respectively.
  - Renamed functions `smallereq` and `largereq` to `smallerEq` and `largerEq`.
  - Renamed function `unary` to `unaryMinus` and added support for strings.
- `end` is now a reserved keyword which cannot be used as function or symbol
  name in the expression parser, and is not allowed in the scope against which
  an expression is evaluated.
- Implemented function `unaryPlus` and unary plus operator.
- Implemented function `deepEqual` for matrix comparisons.
- Added constant `phi`, the golden ratio (`phi = 1.618...`).

- Added unit `drop` (`gtt`).
- Fixed not being able to load math.js using AMD/require.js.

  This functionality can be restored by pre- or postprocessing every evaluation,
  something like:

        function evalWithAns (expr, scope) {
          var ans = math.eval(expr, scope);
          if (scope) {
            scope.ans = ans;
          }
          return ans;
        }

## 2014-01-18, version 0.18.0

- Changed matrix index notation of expression parser from round brackets to
  square brackets, for example `A[1, 1:3]` instead of `A(1, 1:3)`.
- Removed need to use the `function` keyword for function assignments in the
  expression parser, you can define a function now like `f(x) = x^2`.
- Implemented a compilation step in the expression parser: expressions are
  compiled into JavaScript, giving much better performance (easily 10x as fast).
- Renamed unit conversion function and operator `in` to `to`. Operator `in` is
  still available in the expression parser as an alias for `to`. Added unit
  `in`, an abbreviation for `inch`. Thanks Elijah Insua (@tmpvar).
- Added plurals and aliases for units.
- Implemented an argument `includeEnd` for function `range` (false by default).
- Ranges in the expression parser now support big numbers.
- Implemented functions `permutations` and `combinations`.
  Thanks Daniel Levin (@daniel-levin).
- Added lower case abbreviation `l` for unit litre.


## 2013-12-19, version 0.17.1

## 2013-12-12, version 0.17.0

- Renamed and flattened configuration settings:
  - `number.defaultType` is now `number`.
  - `number.precision` is now `decimals`.
  - `matrix.defaultType` is now `matrix`.
- Function `multiply` now consistently outputs a complex number on complex input.
- Fixed `mod` and `in` not working as function (only as operator).
- Fixed support for old browsers (IE8 and older), compatible when using es5-shim.
- Fixed support for Java's ScriptEngine.


## 2013-11-28, version 0.16.0

- Implemented BigNumber support for arbitrary precision calculations.
  Added settings `number.defaultType` and `number.precision` to configure
  big numbers.
- Documentation is extended.
- Removed utility functions `isScalar`, `toScalar`, `isVector`, `toVector`
  from `Matrix` and `Range`. Use `math.squeeze` and `math.size` instead.
- Implemented functions `get` and `set` on `Matrix`, for easier and faster
  retrieval/replacement of elements in a matrix.
- Implemented function `resize`, handling matrices, scalars, and strings.
- Functions `ones` and `zeros` now return an empty matrix instead of a
  number 1 or 0 when no arguments are provided.
- Implemented functions `min` and `max` for `Range` and `Index`.
- Resizing matrices now leaves new elements undefined by default instead of
  filling them with zeros. Function `resize` now has an extra optional
  parameter `defaultValue`.
- Range operator `:` in expression parser has been given a higher precedence.
- Functions don't allow arguments of unknown type anymore.
- Options be set when constructing a math.js instance or using the new function
  `config(options`. Options are no longer accessible via `math.options`.
- Renamed `scientific` notation to `exponential` in function `format`.
- Function `format` outputs exponential notation with positive exponents now
  always with `+` sign, so outputs `2.1e+3` instead of `2.1e3`.
- Fixed function `squeeze` not being able squeeze into a scalar.
- Some fixes and performance improvements in the `resize` and `subset`
  functions.
- Function `size` now adheres to the option `matrix.defaultType` for scalar
  input.
- Minor bug fixes.


## 2013-10-26, version 0.15.0

- Math.js must be instantiated now, static calls are no longer supported. Usage:
  - node.js: `var math = require('mathjs')();`
  - browser: `var math = mathjs();`
- Implemented support for multiplying vectors with matrices.
- Improved number formatting:
  - Function `format` now support various options: precision, different
    notations (`fixed`, `scientific`, `auto`), and more.
  - Numbers are no longer rounded to 5 digits by default when formatted.
  - Implemented a function `format` for `Matrix`, `Complex`, `Unit`, `Range`,
    and `Selector` to format using options.
  - Function `format` does only stringify values now, and has a new parameter
    `precision` to round to a specific number of digits.
  - Removed option `math.options.precision`,
    use `math.format(value [, precision])` instead.
  - Fixed formatting numbers as scientific notation in some cases returning
    a zero digit left from the decimal point. (like "0.33333e8" rather than
    "3.3333e7"). Thanks @husayt.
- Implemented a function `print` to interpolate values in a template string,
  this functionality was moved from the function `format`.
- Implemented statistics function `mean`. Thanks Guillermo Indalecio Fernandez
  (@guillermobox).
- Extended and changed `max` and `min` for multi dimensional matrices: they now
  return the maximum and minimum of the flattened array. An optional second
  argument `dim` allows to calculate the `max` or `min` for specified dimension.
- Renamed option `math.options.matrix.default` to
  `math.options.matrix.defaultType`.
- Removed support for comparing complex numbers in functions `smaller`,
  `smallereq`, `larger`, `largereq`. Complex numbers cannot be ordered.


## 2013-10-08, version 0.14.0

- Introduced an option `math.options.matrix.default` which can have values
  `matrix` (default) or `array`. This option is used by the functions `eye`,
  `ones`, `range`, and `zeros`, to determine the type of matrix output.
- Getting a subset of a matrix will automatically squeeze the resulting subset,
  setting a subset of a matrix will automatically unsqueeze the given subset.
- Removed concatenation of nested arrays in the expression parser.
  You can now input nested arrays like in JavaScript. Matrices can be
  concatenated using the function `concat`.
- The matrix syntax `[...]` in the expression parser now creates 1 dimensional
  matrices by default. `math.eval('[1,2,3,4]')` returns a matrix with
  size `[4]`, `math.eval('[1,2;3,4]')` returns a matrix with size `[2,2]`.
- Documentation is restructured and extended.
- Fixed non working operator `mod` (modulus operator).


## 2013-09-03, version 0.13.0

- Implemented support for booleans in all relevant functions.
- Implemented functions `map` and `forEach`. Thanks Sebastien Piquemal (@sebpic).
- All construction functions can be used to convert the type of variables,
  also element-wise for all elements in an Array or Matrix.
- Changed matrix indexes of the expression parser to one-based with the
  upper-bound included, similar to most math applications. Note that on a
  JavaScript level, math.js uses zero-based indexes with excluded upper-bound.
- Removed support for scalars in the function `subset`, it now only supports
  Array, Matrix, and String.
- Removed the functions `get` and `set` from a selector, they are a duplicate
  of the function `subset`.
- Replaced functions `get` and `set` of `Matrix` with a single function
  `subset`.
- Some moving around with code and namespaces:
  - Renamed namespace `math.expr` to `math.expression` (contains Scope, Parser,
    node objects).
  - Renamed namespace `math.docs` to `math.expression.docs`.
  - Moved `math.expr.Selector` to `math.chaining.Selector`.
- Fixed some edge cases in functions `lcm` and `xgcd`.


## 2013-08-22, version 0.12.1

- Fixed a broken unit test.


## 2013-08-22, version 0.12.0

- Implemented functions `random([min, max])`, `randomInt([min, max])`,
  `pickRandom(array)`. Thanks Sebastien Piquemal (@sebpic).
- Implemented function `distribution(name)`, generating a distribution object
  with functions `random`, `randomInt`, `pickRandom` for different
  distributions. Currently supporting `uniform` and `normal`.
- Changed the behavior of `range` to exclude the upper bound, so `range(1, 4)`
  now returns `[1, 2, 3]` instead of `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
- Changed the syntax of `range`, which is now `range(start, end [, step])`
  instead of `range(start, [step, ] end)`.
- Changed the behavior of `ones` and `zeros` to geometric dimensions, for
  example `ones(3)` returns a vector with length 3, filled with ones, and
  `ones(3,3)` returns a 2D array with size [3, 3].
- Changed the return type of `ones` and `zeros`: they now return an Array when
  arguments are Numbers or an Array, and returns a Matrix when the argument
  is a Matrix.
- Change matrix index notation in parser from round brackets to square brackets,
  for example `A[0, 0:3]`.
- Removed the feature introduced in v0.10.0 to automatically convert a complex
  value with an imaginary part equal to zero to a number.
- Fixed zeros being formatted as null. Thanks @TimKraft.


## 2013-07-23, version 0.11.1

- Some fixes in the end user documentation.


## 2013-07-08, version 0.10.0

- For complex calculations, all functions now automatically replace results
  having an imaginary part of zero with a Number. (`2i * 2i` now returns a
  Number `-4` instead of a Complex `-4 + 0i`).
- Implemented support for injecting custom node handlers in the parser. Can be
  used for example to implement a node handler for plotting a graph.
- Implemented end user documentation and a new `help` function.
- Functions `size` and `squeeze` now return a Matrix instead of an Array as
  output on Matrix input.
- Added a constant tau (2 * pi). Thanks Zak Zibrat (@palimpsests).
- Renamed function `unaryminus` to `unary`.
- Fixed a bug in determining node dependencies in function assignments.

  be a plain JavaScript Object containing variables.
- Extended function `math.expr(expr [, scope])` with an additional parameter
  `scope`, similar to `parse`. Example: `math.eval('x^a', {x:3, a:2});`.
- Implemented function `subset`, to get or set a subset from a matrix, string,
  or other data types.
- Implemented construction functions number and string (mainly useful inside
  the parser).
- Improved function `det`. Thanks Bryan Cuccioli (@bcuccioli).
- Moved the parse code from prototype math.expr.Parser to function math.parse,
  simplified Parser a little bit.

- Implemented a command line interface. When math.js is installed globally via
  npm, the application is available on your system as 'mathjs'.
- Implemented `end` keyword for index operator, and added support for implicit
  start and end (expressions like `a(2,:)` and `b(2:end,3:end-1)` are supported
  now).

- Improvements in the parser:
  - Added support for chained arguments.
  - Added support for chained variable assignments.
  - Added a function remove(name) to remove a variable from the parsers scope.
  - Renamed nodes for more consistency and to resolve naming conflicts.
  - Improved stringification of an expression tree.
  - Some simplifications in the code.
  - Minor bug fixes.
- Fixed a bug in the parser, returning NaN instead of throwing an error for a
  number with multiple decimal separators like `2.3.4`.
- Fixed a bug in Workspace.insertAfter.
- Fixed: math.js now works on IE 6-8 too.


## 2013-04-20, version 0.7.0

- Implemented method `math.eval`, which uses a readonly parser to evaluate
  expressions.
- Implemented method `xgcd` (extended eucledian algorithm). Thanks Bart Kiers
  (@bkiers).
- Improved math.format, which now rounds values to a maximum number of digits
  instead of decimals (default is 5 digits, for example `math.format(math.pi)`
  returns `3.1416`).
- Added examples.
- Changed methods square and cube to evaluate matrices element wise (consistent
  with all other methods).
- Changed second parameter of method import to an object with options.
- Fixed method math.typeof on IE.
- Minor bug fixes and improvements.


## 2013-04-13, version 0.6.0

- Implemented chained operations via method math.select(). For example
  `math.select(3).add(4).subtract(2).done()` will return `5`.
- Implemented methods gcd and lcm.
- Implemented method `Unit.in(unit)`, which creates a clone of the unit with a
  fixed representation. For example `math.unit('5.08 cm').in('inch')` will
  return a unit which string representation always is in inch, thus `2 inch`.
  `Unit.in(unit)` is the same as method `math.in(x, unit)`.
- Implemented `Unit.toNumber(unit)`, which returns the value of the unit when
  represented with given unit. For example
  `math.unit('5.08 cm').toNumber('inch')` returns the number `2`, as the
  representation of the unit in inches has 2 as value.
- Improved: method `math.in(x, unit)` now supports a string as second parameter,
  for example `math.in(math.unit('5.08 cm'), 'inch')`.
- Split the end user documentation of the parser functions from the source
  files.
- Removed function help and the built-in documentation from the core library.
- Fixed constant i being defined as -1i instead of 1i.
- Minor bug fixes.


## 2013-04-06, version 0.5.0

- Implemented data types Matrix and Range.
- Implemented matrix methods clone, concat, det, diag, eye, inv, ones, size,
  squeeze, transpose, zeros.
- Implemented range operator `:`, and transpose operator `'` in parser.
- Changed: created construction methods for easy object creation for all data
  types and for the parser. For example, a complex value is now created
  with `math.complex(2, 3)` instead of `new math.Complex(2, 3)`, and a parser
  is now created with `math.parser()` instead of `new math.parser.Parser()`.
- Changed: moved all data types under the namespace math.type, and moved the
  Parser, Workspace, etc. under the namespace math.expr.
- Changed: changed operator precedence of the power operator:
  - it is now right associative instead of left associative like most scripting
    languages. So `2^3^4` is now calculated as `2^(3^4)`.
  - it has now higher precedence than unary minus most languages, thus `-3^2` is
    now calculated as `-(3^2)`.
- Changed: renamed the parsers method 'put' into 'set'.
- Fixed: method 'in' did not check for units to have the same base.
