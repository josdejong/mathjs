## 2018-02-25, version 4.0.0

!!! BE CAREFUL: BREAKING CHANGES !!!

Breaking changes (see also #682):

- **New expression compiler**

    The compiler of the expression parser is replaced with one that doesn't use
    `eval` internally. See #1019. This means:

    - a slightly improved performance on most browsers.
    - less risk of security exploits.
    - the code of the new compiler is easier to understand, maintain, and debug.

    Breaking change here: When using custom nodes in the expression parser,
    the syntax of `_compile` has changed. This is an undocumented feature though.

- **Parsed expressions**

    - The class `ConstantNode` is changed such that it just holds a value
      instead of holding a stringified value and it's type.
      `ConstantNode(valueStr, valueType`) is now `ConstantNode(value)`
      Stringification uses `math.format`, which may result in differently
      formatted numeric output.

    - The constants `true`, `false`, `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`, `Infinity`,
      and `uninitialized` are now parsed as ConstantNodes instead of
      SymbolNodes in the expression parser. See #833.

- **Implicit multiplication**

    - Changed the behavior of implicit multiplication to have higher
      precedence than explicit multiplication and division, except in
      a number of specific cases. This gives a more natural behavior
      for implicit multiplications. For example `24h / 6h` now returns `4`,
      whilst `1/2 kg` evaluates to `0.5 kg`. Thanks @ericman314. See: #792.
      Detailed documentation: https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs/blob/v4/docs/expressions/syntax.md#implicit-multiplication.

    - Immediately invoking a function returned by a function like `partialAdd(2)(3)`
      is no longer supported, instead these expressions are evaluated as
      an implicit multiplication `partialAdd(2) * (3)`. See #1035.

- **String formatting**

    - In function `math.format`, the options `{exponential: {lower: number, upper: number}}`
      (where `lower` and `upper` are values) are replaced with `{lowerExp: number, upperExp: number}`
      (where `lowerExp` and `upperExp` are exponents). See #676. For example:
      ```js
      math.format(2000, {exponential: {lower: 1e-2, upper: 1e2}})
      ```
      is now:
      ```js
      math.format(2000, {lowerExp: -2, upperExp: 2})
      ```

    - In function `math.format`, the option `notation: 'fixed'` no longer rounds to
      zero digits  when no precision is specified: it leaves the digits as is.
      See #676.

- **String comparison**

    Changed the behavior of relational functions (`compare`, `equal`,
    `equalScalar`, `larger`, `largerEq`, `smaller`, `smallerEq`, `unequal`)
    to compare strings by their numeric value they contain instead of
    alphabetically. This also impacts functions `deepEqual`, `sort`, `min`,
    `max`, `median`, and `partitionSelect`. Use `compareNatural` if you
    need to sort an array with text. See #680.

- **Angle units**

    Changed `rad`, `deg`, and `grad` to have short prefixes,
    and introduced `radian`, `degree`, and `gradian` and their plurals
    having long prefixes. See #749.

- **Null**

    - `null` is no longer implicitly casted to a number `0`, so input like
      `math.add(2, null)` is no longer supported. See #830, #353.

    - Dropped constant `uninitialized`, which was used to initialize
      leave new entries undefined when resizing a matrix is removed.
      Use `undefined` instead to indicate entries that are not explicitly
      set. See #833.

- **New typed-function library**

    - The `typed-function` library used to check the input types
      of functions is completely rewritten and doesn't use `eval` under
      the hood anymore. This means a reduced security risk, and easier
      to debug code. The API is the same, but error messages may differ
      a bit. Performance is comparable but may differ in specific
      use cases and browsers.

Non breaking changes:

- Thanks to the new expression compiler and `typed-function` implementation,
  mathjs doesn't use JavaScript's `eval` anymore under the hood.
  This allows using mathjs in environments with security restrictions.
  See #401.
- Implemented additional methods `isUnary()` and `isBinary()` on
  `OperatorNode`. See #1025.
- Improved error messages for statistical functions.
- Upgraded devDependencies.
- Fixed #1014: `derivative` silently dropping additional arguments
  from operator nodes with more than two arguments.


## 2018-02-07, version 3.20.2

- Upgraded to `typed-function@0.10.7` (bug-fix release).

- Fixed `simplify` evalution of `simplify` of functions with more than two 
  arguments wrongly: `simplify('f(x, y, z)') evaluated to `f(f(x, y), z)`
  instead of `f(x, y, z)`. Thanks @joelhoover.
- Fixed `simplify` throwing an error in some cases when simplifying unknown
  functions, for example `simplify('f(4)')`. Thanks @joelhoover.

## 2016-03-04, version 3.0.0

### breaking changes

- More restricted support for implicit multiplication in the expression
  parser: `(...)(...)` is now evaluated as a function invocation,
  and `[...][...]` as a matrix subset.
- Matrix multiplication no longer squeezes scalar outputs to a scalar value,
  but leaves them as they are: a vector or matrix containing a single value.
  See #529.
- Assignments in the expression parser now return the assigned value rather
  than the created or updated object (see #533). Example:

  ```
  A = eye(3)
  A[1,1] = 2   # this assignment now returns 2 instead of A
  ```

- Expression parser now supports objects. This involves a refactoring and
  extension in expression nodes:
  - Implemented new node `ObjectNode`.
  - Refactored `AssignmentNode`, `UpdateNode`, and `IndexNode` are refactored
    into `AccessorNode`, `AssignmentNode`, and `IndexNode` having a different API.
- Upgraded the used BigNumber library `decimal.js` to v5. Replaced the
  trigonometric functions of math.js with those provided in decimal.js v5.
  This can give slightly different behavior qua round-off errors.
- Replaced the internal `Complex.js` class with the `complex.js` library
  created by @infusion.
- Entries in a matrix (typically numbers, BigNumbers, Units, etc) are now
  considered immutable, they are no longer copied when performing operations on
  the entries, improving performance.
- Implemented nearly equal comparison for relational functions (`equal`,
  `larger`, `smaller`, etc.) when using BigNumbers.
- Changed the casing of the configuration options `matrix` (`Array` or `Matrix`)
  and `number` (`number`, `BigNumber`, `Fraction`) such that they now match
  the type returned by `math.typeof`. Wrong casing gives a console warning but
  will still work.
- Changed the default config value for `epsilon` from `1e-14` to `1e-12`,
  see #561.

### non-breaking changes

- Extended function `pow` to return the real root for cubic roots of negative
  numbers. See #525, #482, #567.
- Implemented support for JSON objects in the expression parser and the
  function `math.format`.
- Function `math.fraction` now supports `BigNumber`, and function
  `math.bignumber` now supports `Fraction`.
- Expression parser now allows function and/or variable assignments inside
  accessors and conditionals, like `A[x=2]` or `a > 2 ? b="ok" : b="fail"`.
- Command line interface:
  - Outputs the variable name of assignments.
  - Fixed not rounding BigNumbers to 14 digits like numbers.
  - Fixed non-working autocompletion of user defined variables.
- Reorganized and extended docs, added docs on classes and more. Thanks @hgupta9.
- Added new units `acre`, `hectare`, `torr`, `bar`, `mmHg`, `mmH2O`, `cmH2O`,
  and added new aliases `acres`, `hectares`, `sqfeet`, `sqyard`, `sqmile`,
  `sqmiles`, `mmhg`, `mmh2o`, `cmh2o`. Thanks @hgupta9.
- Fixed a bug in the toString method of an IndexNode.
- Fixed angle units `deg`, `rad`, `grad`, `cycle`, `arcsec`, and `arcmin` not
  being defined as BigNumbers when configuring to use BigNumbers.

  `isPositive`, and `isZero`.

### breaking changes

- String input is now converted to numbers by default for all functions. 
- Adding two strings will no longer concatenate them, but will convert the 
  strings to numbers and add them.
- Function `index` does no longer accept an array `[start, end, step]`, but
  instead accepts an array with arbitrary index values. It also accepts
  a `Range` object as input.
- Function `typeof` no longer returns lower case names, but now returns lower
  case names for primitives (like `number`, `boolean`, `string`), and 
  upper-camel-case for non-primitives (like `Array`, `Complex`, `Function`).
- Function `import` no longer supports a module name as argument. Instead,
  modules can be loaded using require: `math.import(require('module-name'))`.

- Fixed #397: Inaccuracies in nthRoot for very large values, and wrong results 
  for very small values. (backported from v2)

- Officially opened up the API of expression trees:
  - Documented the API.
  - Implemented recursive functions `clone`, `map`, `forEach`, `traverse`,
    `transform`, and `filter` for expression trees.

    - `FunctionNode` now has a `name: string` instead of a `symbol: SymbolNode`.
    - Changed constructor of `RangeNode` to

- `math.number` can convert units to numbers (requires a second argument)
- Fixed some precedence issues with the range and conversion operators.
- Fixed an zero-based issue when getting a matrix subset using an index 
  containing a matrix.


## 2014-08-21, version 0.27.0

- Implemented functions `sort(x [, compare])` and `flatten(x)`.
- Implemented support for `null` in all functions.
- Implemented support for "rawArgs" functions in the expression parser. Raw 
  functions are invoked with unevaluated parameters (nodes).
- Expressions in the expression parser can now be spread over multiple lines,
  like '2 +\n3'.
- Changed default value of the option `wrap` of function `math.import` to false.
- Changed the default value for new entries in a resized matrix when to zero. 
  To leave new entries uninitialized, use the new constant `math.uninitialized` 
  as default value.
- Renamed transform property from `__transform__` to `transform`, and documented
  the transform feature.
- Fixed a bug in `math.import` not applying options when passing a module name.
- A returned matrix subset is now only squeezed when the `index` consists of
  scalar values, and no longer for ranges resolving into a single value. 


## 2014-08-03, version 0.26.0

- A new instance of math.js can no longer be created like `math([options])`,
  to prevent side effects from math being a function instead of an object.
  Instead, use the function `math.create([options])` to create a new instance.
- Implemented `BigNumber` support for all constants: `pi`, `tau`, `e`, `phi`,
  `E`, `LN2`, `LN10`, `LOG2E`, `LOG10E`, `PI`, `SQRT1_2`, and `SQRT2`.
- Implemented `BigNumber` support for functions `gcd`, `xgcd`, and `lcm`.
- Fixed function `gxcd` returning an Array when math.js was configured 
  as `{matrix: 'matrix'}`.
- Multi-line expressions now return a `ResultSet` instead of an `Array`.
- Implemented transforms (used right now to transform one-based indices to 
  zero-based for expressions).
- When used inside the expression parser, functions `concat`, `min`, `max`,
  and `mean` expect an one-based dimension number.
- Functions `map` and `forEach` invoke the callback with one-based indices
  when used from within the expression parser.
- When adding or removing dimensions when resizing a matrix, the dimensions
  are added/removed from the inner side (right) instead of outer side (left).
- Improved index out of range errors.
- Fixed function `concat` not accepting a `BigNumber` for parameter `dim`.
- Function `squeeze` now squeezes both inner and outer singleton dimensions.
- Output of getting a matrix subset is not automatically squeezed anymore
  except for scalar output.
- Renamed `FunctionNode` to `FunctionAssignmentNode`, and renamed `ParamsNode`
  to `FunctionNode` for more clarity.
- Fixed broken auto completion in CLI.
- Some minor fixes.


## 2014-07-01, version 0.25.0

- The library now immediately returns a default instance of mathjs, there is
  no need to instantiate math.js in a separate step unless one ones to set 
  configuration options: 
  
        // instead of:
        var mathjs = require('mathjs'),  // load math.js
            math = mathjs();             // create an instance
      
        // just do:
        var math = require('mathjs');
- Implemented support for implicit multiplication, like `math.eval('2a', {a:3})`
  and `math.eval('(2+3)(1-3)')`. This changes behavior of matrix indexes as 
  well: an expression like `[...][...]` is not evaluated as taking a subset of 
  the first matrix, but as an implicit multiplication of two matrices.
- Removed utility function `ifElse`. This function is redundant now the 
  expression parser has a conditional operator `a ? b : c`.
- Fixed a bug with multiplying a number with a temperature,  
  like `math.eval('10 * celsius')`.
- Fixed a bug with symbols having value `undefined` not being evaluated.


## 2014-06-20, version 0.24.1

- Objects `Complex`, `Unit`, and `Help` now return their string representation
  when calling `.valueOf()`.
- Changed the default number of significant digits for BigNumbers from 20 to 64.
- Changed the behavior of the conditional operator (a ? b : c) to lazy 
  evaluating.
- Fixed imported, wrapped functions not accepting `null` and `undefined` as
  function arguments.


## 2014-06-10, version 0.23.0

- Renamed some functions (everything now has a logical, camel case name):
  - Renamed functions `edivide`, `emultiply`, and `epow` to `dotDivide`, 
    `dotMultiply`, and `dotPow` respectively. 
  - Renamed functions `smallereq` and `largereq` to `smallerEq` and `largerEq`.
  - Renamed function `unary` to `unaryMinus` and added support for strings.
- `end` is now a reserved keyword which cannot be used as function or symbol
  name in the expression parser, and is not allowed in the scope against which
  an expression is evaluated.
- Implemented function `unaryPlus` and unary plus operator.
- Implemented function `deepEqual` for matrix comparisons. 
- Added constant `phi`, the golden ratio (`phi = 1.618...`).
- Added constant `version`, returning the version number of math.js as string.
- Added unit `drop` (`gtt`).
- Fixed not being able to load math.js using AMD/require.js.
- Changed signature of `math.parse(expr, nodes)` to `math.parse(expr, options)`
  where `options: {nodes: Object.<String, Node>}`
- Removed matrix support from conditional function `ifElse`.
- Removed automatic assignment of expression results to variable `ans`. 
  This functionality can be restored by pre- or postprocessing every evaluation, 
  something like:
  
        function evalWithAns (expr, scope) {
          var ans = math.eval(expr, scope);
          if (scope) {
            scope.ans = ans;
          }
          return ans;
        }

  (@nheisterkamp).
- Output of matrix multiplication is now consistently squeezed.
- Added reference documentation in the section /docs/reference.
- Fixed a bug in multiplying units without value with a number (like `5 * cm`).
- Fixed a bug in multiplying two matrices containing vectors (worked fine for 
  arrays).
- Fixed random functions not accepting Matrix as input, and always returning
  a Matrix as output.


## 2014-05-13, version 0.21.1

- Removed `crypto` library from the bundle.
- Deprecated functions `Parser.parse` and `Parser.compile`. Use
  `math.parse` and `math.compile` instead.

  square brackets, for example `A[1, 1:3]` instead of `A(1, 1:3)`.
- Removed need to use the `function` keyword for function assignments in the
  expression parser, you can define a function now like `f(x) = x^2`.
- Implemented a compilation step in the expression parser: expressions are
  compiled into JavaScript, giving much better performance (easily 10x as fast).
- Renamed unit conversion function and operator `in` to `to`. Operator `in` is
  still available in the expression parser as an alias for `to`. Added unit
  `in`, an abbreviation for `inch`. Thanks Elijah Insua (@tmpvar).

  Added settings `number.defaultType` and `number.precision` to configure
  big numbers.
- Documentation is extended.
- Removed utility functions `isScalar`, `toScalar`, `isVector`, `toVector`
  from `Matrix` and `Range`. Use `math.squeeze` and `math.size` instead.
- Implemented functions `get` and `set` on `Matrix`, for easier and faster
  retrieval/replacement of elements in a matrix.
- Implemented function `resize`, handling matrices, scalars, and strings.
- Functions `ones` and `zeros` now return an empty matrix instead of a
  number 1 or 0 when no arguments are provided.
- Implemented functions `min` and `max` for `Range` and `Index`.
- Resizing matrices now leaves new elements undefined by default instead of
  filling them with zeros. Function `resize` now has an extra optional
  parameter `defaultValue`.
- Range operator `:` in expression parser has been given a higher precedence.
- Functions don't allow arguments of unknown type anymore.
- Options be set when constructing a math.js instance or using the new function
  `config(options`. Options are no longer accessible via `math.options`.
- Renamed `scientific` notation to `exponential` in function `format`.

## 2013-10-26, version 0.15.0

- Math.js must be instantiated now, static calls are no longer supported. Usage:
  - node.js: `var math = require('mathjs')();`
  - browser: `var math = mathjs();`
- Implemented support for multiplying vectors with matrices.
- Improved number formatting:
  - Function `format` now support various options: precision, different
    notations (`fixed`, `scientific`, `auto`), and more.
  - Numbers are no longer rounded to 5 digits by default when formatted.
  - Implemented a function `format` for `Matrix`, `Complex`, `Unit`, `Range`,
    and `Selector` to format using options.
  - Function `format` does only stringify values now, and has a new parameter
    `precision` to round to a specific number of digits.
  - Removed option `math.options.precision`,
    use `math.format(value [, precision])` instead.
  - Fixed formatting numbers as scientific notation in some cases returning
    a zero digit left from the decimal point. (like "0.33333e8" rather than
    "3.3333e7"). Thanks @husayt.
- Implemented a function `print` to interpolate values in a template string,
  this functionality was moved from the function `format`.
- Implemented statistics function `mean`. Thanks Guillermo Indalecio Fernandez
  (@guillermobox).
- Extended and changed `max` and `min` for multi dimensional matrices: they now
  return the maximum and minimum of the flattened array. An optional second
  argument `dim` allows to calculate the `max` or `min` for specified dimension.
- Renamed option `math.options.matrix.default` to
  `math.options.matrix.defaultType`.
- Removed support for comparing complex numbers in functions `smaller`,
  `smallereq`, `larger`, `largereq`. Complex numbers cannot be ordered.


## 2013-10-08, version 0.14.0

- Introduced an option `math.options.matrix.default` which can have values
  `matrix` (default) or `array`. This option is used by the functions `eye`,
  `ones`, `range`, and `zeros`, to determine the type of matrix output.
- Getting a subset of a matrix will automatically squeeze the resulting subset,
  setting a subset of a matrix will automatically unsqueeze the given subset.
- Removed concatenation of nested arrays in the expression parser.
  You can now input nested arrays like in JavaScript. Matrices can be
  concatenated using the function `concat`.
- The matrix syntax `[...]` in the expression parser now creates 1 dimensional
  matrices by default. `math.eval('[1,2,3,4]')` returns a matrix with
  size `[4]`, `math.eval('[1,2;3,4]')` returns a matrix with size `[2,2]`.
- Documentation is restructured and extended.
- Fixed non working operator `mod` (modulus operator).


## 2013-09-03, version 0.13.0

- Implemented support for booleans in all relevant functions.
- Implemented functions `map` and `forEach`. Thanks Sebastien Piquemal (@sebpic).
- All construction functions can be used to convert the type of variables,
  also element-wise for all elements in an Array or Matrix.
- Changed matrix indexes of the expression parser to one-based with the
  upper-bound included, similar to most math applications. Note that on a
  JavaScript level, math.js uses zero-based indexes with excluded upper-bound.
- Removed support for scalars in the function `subset`, it now only supports
  Array, Matrix, and String.
- Removed the functions `get` and `set` from a selector, they are a duplicate
  of the function `subset`.
- Replaced functions `get` and `set` of `Matrix` with a single function
  `subset`.
- Some moving around with code and namespaces:
  - Renamed namespace `math.expr` to `math.expression` (contains Scope, Parser,
    node objects).
  - Renamed namespace `math.docs` to `math.expression.docs`.
  - Moved `math.expr.Selector` to `math.chaining.Selector`.
- Fixed some edge cases in functions `lcm` and `xgcd`.

## 2013-08-22, version 0.12.0

- Implemented functions `random([min, max])`, `randomInt([min, max])`,
  `pickRandom(array)`. Thanks Sebastien Piquemal (@sebpic).
- Implemented function `distribution(name)`, generating a distribution object
  with functions `random`, `randomInt`, `pickRandom` for different
  distributions. Currently supporting `uniform` and `normal`.
- Changed the behavior of `range` to exclude the upper bound, so `range(1, 4)`
  now returns `[1, 2, 3]` instead of `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
- Changed the syntax of `range`, which is now `range(start, end [, step])`
  instead of `range(start, [step, ] end)`.
- Changed the behavior of `ones` and `zeros` to geometric dimensions, for
  example `ones(3)` returns a vector with length 3, filled with ones, and
  `ones(3,3)` returns a 2D array with size [3, 3].
- Changed the return type of `ones` and `zeros`: they now return an Array when
  arguments are Numbers or an Array, and returns a Matrix when the argument
  is a Matrix.
- Change matrix index notation in parser from round brackets to square brackets,
  for example `A[0, 0:3]`.
- Removed the feature introduced in v0.10.0 to automatically convert a complex
  value with an imaginary part equal to zero to a number.
- Fixed zeros being formatted as null. Thanks @TimKraft.


## 2013-07-23, version 0.11.1

- Some fixes in the end user documentation.


## 2013-07-08, version 0.10.0

- For complex calculations, all functions now automatically replace results
  having an imaginary part of zero with a Number. (`2i * 2i` now returns a
  Number `-4` instead of a Complex `-4 + 0i`).
- Implemented support for injecting custom node handlers in the parser. Can be
  used for example to implement a node handler for plotting a graph.
- Implemented end user documentation and a new `help` function.
- Functions `size` and `squeeze` now return a Matrix instead of an Array as
  output on Matrix input.

- Extended function `math.expr(expr [, scope])` with an additional parameter
  `scope`, similar to `parse`. Example: `math.eval('x^a', {x:3, a:2});`.
- Implemented function `subset`, to get or set a subset from a matrix, string,
  or other data types.
- Implemented construction functions number and string (mainly useful inside
  the parser).

- Improvements in the parser:
  - Added support for chained arguments.
  - Added support for chained variable assignments.
  - Added a function remove(name) to remove a variable from the parsers scope.
  - Renamed nodes for more consistency and to resolve naming conflicts.
  - Improved stringification of an expression tree.
  - Some simplifications in the code.
  - Minor bug fixes.
- Fixed a bug in the parser, returning NaN instead of throwing an error for a
  number with multiple decimal separators like `2.3.4`.
- Fixed a bug in Workspace.insertAfter.
- Fixed: math.js now works on IE 6-8 too.


## 2013-04-20, version 0.7.0

- Implemented method `math.eval`, which uses a readonly parser to evaluate
  expressions.
- Implemented method `xgcd` (extended eucledian algorithm). Thanks Bart Kiers
  (@bkiers).
- Improved math.format, which now rounds values to a maximum number of digits
  instead of decimals (default is 5 digits, for example `math.format(math.pi)`
  returns `3.1416`).

  with all other methods).
- Changed second parameter of method import to an object with options.
- Fixed method math.typeof on IE.

## 2013-04-13, version 0.6.0

- Implemented chained operations via method math.select(). For example
  `math.select(3).add(4).subtract(2).done()` will return `5`.
- Implemented methods gcd and lcm.
- Implemented method `Unit.in(unit)`, which creates a clone of the unit with a
  fixed representation. For example `math.unit('5.08 cm').in('inch')` will
  return a unit which string representation always is in inch, thus `2 inch`.
  `Unit.in(unit)` is the same as method `math.in(x, unit)`.
- Implemented `Unit.toNumber(unit)`, which returns the value of the unit when
  represented with given unit. For example
  `math.unit('5.08 cm').toNumber('inch')` returns the number `2`, as the
  representation of the unit in inches has 2 as value.
- Improved: method `math.in(x, unit)` now supports a string as second parameter,
  for example `math.in(math.unit('5.08 cm'), 'inch')`.
- Split the end user documentation of the parser functions from the source
  files.
- Removed function help and the built-in documentation from the core library.
- Fixed constant i being defined as -1i instead of 1i.
- Minor bug fixes.


## 2013-04-06, version 0.5.0

- Implemented data types Matrix and Range.
- Implemented matrix methods clone, concat, det, diag, eye, inv, ones, size,
  squeeze, transpose, zeros.
- Implemented range operator `:`, and transpose operator `'` in parser.
- Changed: created construction methods for easy object creation for all data
  types and for the parser. For example, a complex value is now created
  with `math.complex(2, 3)` instead of `new math.Complex(2, 3)`, and a parser
  is now created with `math.parser()` instead of `new math.parser.Parser()`.
- Changed: moved all data types under the namespace math.type, and moved the
  Parser, Workspace, etc. under the namespace math.expr.
- Changed: changed operator precedence of the power operator:
  - it is now right associative instead of left associative like most scripting
    languages. So `2^3^4` is now calculated as `2^(3^4)`.
  - it has now higher precedence than unary minus most languages, thus `-3^2` is
    now calculated as `-(3^2)`.
- Changed: renamed the parsers method 'put' into 'set'.
- Fixed: method 'in' did not check for units to have the same base.
