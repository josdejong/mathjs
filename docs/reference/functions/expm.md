# Function expm

Compute the matrix exponential, expm(A) = e^A. The matrix must be square.
Not to be confused with exp(a), which performs element-wise
exponentiation.

The exponential is calculated using the Pad√© approximant with scaling and
squaring; see "Nineteen Dubious Ways to Compute the Exponential of a
Matrix," by Moler and Van Loan.


## Syntax

```js
math.expm(x)
```

### Parameters

Matrix | The exponential of x


## Examples

```js
const A = [[0,2],[0,0]]
math.expm(A)        // returns [[1,2],[0,1]]
```
